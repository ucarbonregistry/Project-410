1.6 MW Bundled Wind Power Project by MFPL

The proposed project titled under UCR is “1.6 MW Bundled Wind Power Project by MFPL”, which is
wind power project located in Rajkot and Jamnagar district in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose
of this plant installation and power generation is for captive consumption. The project is an operational
activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry”
(UCR).

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of 2 Wind Turbine Generator (WTG). This project has been promoted by M/s Mascot Forge
Pvt. Ltd. 

The details of wind turbine is given below –

Gujarat--- Padavala----- Rajkot------- EIL/800/09-10/1659---------- 0.8------------- 29/03/2010
______________________
Gujarat--- Jodhpar----- Jamnagar------- EIL/800/06-07/0168-------- 0.8------------- 22/09/2006

As per the ex-ante estimate, the project will generate approximately 2803 MWh of electricity per annum.
The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the project
proponent (PP). Wheeling agreement is signed between Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation
Limited (GETCO) and PP for Jodhpar site and for the padavala wind turbine the wheeling agreement is
signed between Panschim Gujarat Vij Company Limited (PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would
be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity resulting in emission reduction of 2522 tCO2 per
annum. The project activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using
renewable resources (wind energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated
using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants.
The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected
to be 2,522 tCO2e, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be
submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
